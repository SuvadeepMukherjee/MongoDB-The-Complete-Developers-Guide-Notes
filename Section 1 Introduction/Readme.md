What is MongoDb ? 

- Mongodb means humongous (because it can store lots and lots of data)
- Inside a database we have collections
- Inside a collection we have documents 
- These documents are stored in JSON(BSON) data format
- MongoDB converts the JSON data format to BSON(binary version of JSON) which can be stored and querried more efficiently
